HIVE < New York City > < 8:01 am >

**Game idea:**

The basic idea of this game will be to get to the top of the building no matter what. You may have to use unorthodox methods to climb your way on top of the food chain. What will wait on the top? What secrets does this company hide?

Every floor of the building represents one level. Every worker on the floors wear the same tie (everyone except the floor's 'boss' who wears the same tie as the workers the floor above). Your goal is to sabotage this boss in any way to get a promotion. If you pass the level you can use the elevator who brings you to the next level (higher floor).

**Preview**

I am documenting my [creation progress](https://github.com/ImBadAtPickinUsernames/hive-project/issues/2) in an issue.

**Controls:**

**A** - walk left

**D** - walk right

**W** - toggle inventory

**E** - pick up/use something

**SPACEBAR** - jump _(no use for now)_

**Inspired by:**

George Cruikshank's British Bee Hive, originally sketched in 1840, here reprinted in 1867, depicts a vast range of Britain's professions within a strictly divided pyramid-based social hierarchy. In the 19th century the bee was a popular symbol of industry and co-operation.
